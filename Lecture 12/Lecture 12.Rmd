# Section 1.1

load bio3D package and download 1HSG pdb file
```{r}
library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

Read pdb structure
```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
```

##Q1
non-protein residue: water and MK1
What does resid correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure?
```{r}
hiv$atom
```

# Section 1.2

Select out protein and ligand only
```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
prot
lig
```

Write out these new pdb files
```{r}
write.pdb(prot, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(lig, "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```

# Section 1.3
```{r}
