# Section 1: Differential Expression Analysis
```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```
Load Data files
```{r}
metaFile <- "data/GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "data/GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"
```

Look at metadata
```{r}
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names = 1)
head(colData)
```

Import countdata
```{r}
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

Want countData and colData files to match up
so remove odd first column in countData
```{r}
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```

Filter countData where have 0 read count across all samples
```{r}
countData = countData[rowSums(countData) > 1, ]
head(countData)
```

Set up DESeqDataSet object required for DESeq()
```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countData, colData = colData, design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```

```{r}
dds
```

How many genes in the orginal data
```{r}
dim(countData)
nrow(countData)
```

get results for the HoxA1 knowkdown vs. control siRNA
```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```

reorder results by p-value and call summary
```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
summary(res)
#LFC -> log fold change
```
Since we mapped and counted against the Ensembl annotation, our results only have information about Ensembl gene IDs. However, our pathway analysis downstream will use KEGG pathways, and genes in KEGG pathways are annotated with Entrez gene IDs. So lets add them as we did the last day.
```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

```{r}
res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=row.names(res), column="SYMBOL", keytype = "ENSEMBL", multiVals = "first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=row.names(res), column="ENTREZID", keytype = "ENSEMBL", multiVals = "first")

res$name = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=row.names(res), column="GENENAME", keytype = "ENSEMBL", multiVals = "first")

head(res, 10)
```

# Section 2: Pathway Analysis

KEGG
```{r}
# one time install
#source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data("kegg.sets.hs")
data("sigmet.idx.hs")

kegg.sets.hs <- kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.
```{r}
foldchanges <- res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) <- res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Get results
```{r}
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs, same.dir = TRUE)
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$greater)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

```{r}
lapply(keggres, head)
```

Now, let’s process the results to pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the IDs. We’ll use these KEGG pathway IDs downstream for plotting.
```{r}
pathways <- data.frame(id=rownames(keggres$greater), keggres$greater)
head(pathways)
```

Now, let’s try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our result shown in color. To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa04110 Cell cycle") that we could see from the print out above.
```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id ="hsa04110")
```

```{r}
# A different PDF based output of the same data
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110", kegg.native=FALSE)
```

Here is the default low resolution raster PNG output from the first pathview() call above:
(will show up when I knit it)
![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
```{r}
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]
```

Extract the IDs part of each string
```{r}
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.
```{r}
pathview(gene.data = foldchanges, pathway.id = keggresids, species ="hsa")
```

# Section 3: Gene Ontology (GO)
We can also do a similar procedure with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms. go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF ontologies. Let’s only do Biological Process.
```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]
# BP -> biological processes
gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets = gobpsets, same.dir = TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

#Section 4: Reactome Pathway Analysis
First, Using R, output the list of significant genes at the 0.05 level as a plain text file:
```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <- 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length (sig_genes)))
write.table(sig_genes, file = "significant_genes.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

Question: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

not the same
